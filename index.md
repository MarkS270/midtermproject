Hello, my name is Mark and this website will talk about the reason behind my project, the materials I used to make my project , the steps i took to mae this project possibe, and the end result along with some pictues on each page. 

In the beginning of my midterm project, I started to reaseach and brainstorm ideas on what I can do. After some time I chose to make a lock mechanism, that could chnage it's wanted output to what the person intended= or wanted it to be. The lock mechanism would be in a box and to open the box you would have to find the correct combination. The box would have buttons that you had to click at the right time of the clock that would turn on and off.

This project would be similar to the box found on youtube called the 'The Useless Box' since there is no prize in the box. For my box it will be similar that it won't have a reward, but after some concideration, i chose that the box can be opened at any time showing the uselessness for finding the correct combination. The box I would create would be called the 'LED Useless Box'.


For anyone who wants to build it, here are the materials used in the construction of 'LED Useless Box' :
    
    - Wires (A Lot)
    
    - 4 input Switch
    
    - Buttons
    
    - LED's

    - Tiny Filing Tool
    
    - A Small box (of any kind since it doesn't affect putting it and it isn't too small)
    
    - Small Breadboard's (Around 2 to 3)
    
    - Chips (Not the food kind, but the logic kind)
          
          - Quad And Gate (74HC08)
          
          - Quad Exclusive Or Gate --> 'XOR Gate' (74HC86)
          
          - Quad Nand Gate (74HC00)
          
          - Dual J-K Flip Flop (74HC73) --> 'Note' : I might be hard to find this gate and it might have a similar Gate #



Here are the steps used to create the bluprints and also the steps used in the contruction of the 'LED Useless Box':
        
        1. Go to Tinkercad (Make an account if you don't have one) and start a new project for Circuits --> Here is the link: "tinkercad.com"

        2. Start making the circuit as shown below:

        3. Make a Truth Table and make sure it fits the logic in the circuit on Tinkercad. (You might have to go through multiple trial and errors to find the most optimal Truth Table)

        4. Follow the blueprint you made on Tinkercad (Make sure the logic works in real life because Tinkercad is just a simulation and will gave different results than what actually will happen.)

        5. After properly checking in Step 4, find the dimensions of the buttons used. After that make small holes for the LED's and for the buttons.( Make sure there are holes for these specific LED's: he button's LED, the clock LED, and the End result LED, and also for the power suply wires. Also, CONTINUE READING) Then take the tiny filing tools and file the hole until the button can fit with minimal space (Make sure to check the hole every time you file to get to the closest exact measurements)

        6. Soder wires to the buttons. (Make sure the wires are of appropriate lengeth) Glue the button into the holes.

        7. Put everything together and make sure it works. 


There you Have it. The instructions and ingredients of how to make the 'LED Useless Box'. Here are some pictures of the end result for my 'LED Useless Box':
