The Midterm project that I chose to do was a box where you had a LED that was blinking and you had to use the button to turn on the LED for the specified button and also figure out the passcode at the same time.


It was similar to what you can find on youtube called 'The Useless Box' since there is no prize in the box and you can open the box at any time.


Here are the materials used in the creation of what I call the 'LED Useless Box' :
    
    - Wires (A Lot)
    
    - 4 input Switch
    
    - Buttons
    
    - LED's

    - Tiny Filing Tool
    
    - A Small box (of any kind since it doesn't affect putting it and it isn't too small)
    
    - Small Breadboard's (Around 2 to 3)
    
    - Chips (Not the food kind, but the logic kind)
          
          - Quad And Gate (74HC08)
          
          - Quad Exclusive Or Gate --> 'XOR Gate' (74HC86)
          
          - Quad Nand Gate (74HC00)
          
          - Dual J-K Flip Flop (74HC73) --> 'Note' : I might be hard to find this gate and it might have a similar Gate #



Hre is the steps I did to create the 'LED Useless Box':
        
        1. Go to Tinkercad (Make an account if you don't have one) and start a new project for Circuits --> Here is the link: "tinkercad.com"

        2. Start making the circuit as shown below

        3. Make a Truth Table and make sure it fits the logic in the circuit on Tinkercad. (You might have to go through multiple trial and errors to find the most optimal Truth Table)

        4. Follow the blueprint you made on Tinkercad (Make sure the logic works in real life because Tinkercad is just a simulation and will gave different results than what actually will happen.)

        5. After properly checking in Step 4, find the dimensions of the buttons used. After that make small holes for the LED's and for the buttons.( Make sure there are holes for these specific LED's: he button's LED, the clock LED, and the End result LED, and also for the power suply wires. Also, CONTINUE READING) Then take the tiny filing tools and file the hole until the button can fit with minimal space (Make sure to check the hole every time you file to get to the closest exact measurements)

        6. Soder wires to the buttons. (Make sure the wires are of appropriate lengeth) Glue the button into the holes.

        7. Put everything together and make sure it works. 


There you Have it. The instructions and ingredients of how to make the 'LED Useless Box'. Here are some pictures of the end result for my 'LED Useless Box':
