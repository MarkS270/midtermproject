# Introduction

Hello, my name is Mark and this website will talk about the reason behind my project, the materials I used to make my project , the steps i took to mae this project possibe, and the end result along with some pictues on each page. 

In the beginning of my midterm project, I started to reaseach and brainstorm ideas on what I can do. After some time I chose to make a lock mechanism, that could chnage it's wanted output to what the person intended or wanted it to be. The lock mechanism would be in a box and to open the box you would have to find the correct combination. The box would have buttons that you had to click at the right time of the clock that would turn on and off. 

This project would be similar to the box found on youtube called the _'The Useless Box'_ since there is no prize in the box. For my box it will be similar that it won't have a reward, but after some concideration, i chose that the box can be opened at any time showing the uselessness for finding the correct combination. The box I would create would be called the _'LED Combination Box'_.
