The Midterm project that I chose to do was a box where you had a LED that was blinking and you had to use the button to turn on the LED for the specified button and also figure out the passcode at the same time.

It was similar to what you can find on youtube called 'The Useless Box' since there is no prize in the box and you can open the box at any time.


Here are the materials used in the creation of what I call the 'LED Useless Box' :
    - Wires (A Lot)
    - 4 input Switch
    - Buttons
    - LED's
    - A Small box (of any kind since it doesn't affect putting it and it isn't too small)
    - Small Breadboard's (Around 2 to 3)
    - Chips (Not the food kind, but the logic kind)
          - Quad And Gate (74HC08)
          - Quad Exclusive Or Gate --> 'XOR Gate' (74HC86)
          - Quad Nand Gate (74HC00)
          - Dual J-K Flip Flop (74HC73) --> 'Note' : I might be hard to find this gate and it might have a similar Gate #
